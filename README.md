Pomodoro Clock
========

A FreeCodeCamp challenge where we are supposed to build a Pomodoro Clock. Yeah!

Pomodoro is a method of working, where one works very focused and without any distraction for 25 minutes, then takes a five-minute break and works for another 25 minutes, then takes a break again and so on. After four 25-minute sessions, there is a longer break of about 15 minutes. This cycle is repeated again and again.

Our Timer shows how much of the 25 minutes are over yet. The user can start, stop and reset the timer. Further there will be a settings page where the user can adjust the length of the work sessions or the breaks and the background-color of the app.
